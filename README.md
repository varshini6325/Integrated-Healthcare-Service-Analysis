## Overview


Efficient healthcare delivery relies on understanding how and when services are used. This project analyzes historical service usage data to uncover trends, high-demand areas, and behavior patterns among patients. The primary objectives are:

•⁠ ⁠To conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA).   
•⁠ To visualize key patterns in service usage.   
•⁠ To derive insights that support better healthcare resource allocation.   
•⁠ To lay the groundwork for future predictive modeling.   
### Data Cleaning and Transformation:
◦ Handling missing values           
◦ Dropping unnecessary columns   
◦ Converting dates to appropriate datetime formats

### Exploratory Data Analysis:
◦ Visualization of null values using heatmaps   
◦ Understanding service usage trends over time

### Service Usage Insights:
◦ Identification of top-used services by month and year   
◦ Grouped analysis of patient interactions

### Data Visualization:
◦ Graphical representation of service usage trends and top-used categories


## Dataset
The dataset consists of Integrated Healthcare Service Analysiss data with the following columns:

•⁠  ⁠patient_id, service_type, visit_date, visit_count, demographic_info, cost and more.   
•⁠  ⁠Includes sales, inventory, and transactional details.
 
## Workflow
The notebook follows a systematic workflow:

*1. Import Libraries:* Load essential Python libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn.  

*2. Load Data:* Read the dataset from an Excel file.  

*3. Data Cleaning:*  
     ◦ Drop unnecessary columns.  
     ◦ Handle missing values.  
     ◦ Convert date columns to proper datetime formats.  
     
*4. EDA:*  
     ◦ Check and visualize null values.  
     ◦ Summarize data using value_counts and group by operations.
     
*5. Data Transformation:*  
     ◦ Extract year and month from dates.  
     ◦ Aggregate sales data by grouping.  
     
*6. Visualization:*   
     ◦ Plot trends for top-selling items by month and year.  
     
## Technologies Used
•⁠  ⁠*Programming Language:* Python
•⁠  ⁠*Libraries:*  
    ◦ *Data Handling:* pandas, numpy  
    ◦ *Data Visualization:* matplotlib, seaborn, exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
    ◦ *Datetime Processing:* datetime, calendar

## Usage  
*1. Clone the repository:*  
   ⁠  
git clone [https://github.com/your-varshinimahankali/healthcare-services-analysis.git](https://github.com/varshini6325/Integrated-Healthcare-Service-Analysis)

    ⁠ 

*2. Install required Python libraries:*  

    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
    
*3. Open and execute the Project.ipynb notebook:*   
        ◦ Load the dataset by specifying the correct path.  
        ◦ Follow the notebook steps to preprocess and analyze the data.  

## Results
•⁠  ⁠Identified peak usage periods for healthcare services.   
•⁠  Detected patterns based on service categories.   
•⁠  Highlighted potential areas for resource optimization.
## Future Work
•⁠  ⁠Enhance the predictive capability using advanced machine learning models.   
•⁠  ⁠Incorporate external data sources for more robust sales forecasting.   
•⁠  ⁠Automate the pipeline for real-time data analysis.
